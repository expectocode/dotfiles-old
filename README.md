Configuration for my i3 rice

![screencast of my setup](/screencast.gif)

Directory structure should be pretty self explanatory, you might want to read the i3 config carefully since it's quite messy.

 - Run lemonbar wth `<download location>/scripts/lemonbar/unifiedparts &`.

 - You might also want to get [scroller](https://github.com/kbrgl/scroller).

 - Several of the scripts need `xdotool`, and some need `python3`

 -  the terminal is `urxvt` / `rxvt-unicode`
